# Linux Audio

The Linux Audio Architecture is nicely described at
[thewelltemperedcomputer.com](https://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/Linux/AudioArchitecture.htm).
More technical details are given at
[linuxaudio.org](https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/start).
The fearless may even look at the Linux Kernel Sound Subsystem Documentation at
[kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/sound/index.html).
An overview targetet for OpenSuSE users is available at 
[opensuse.org](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Sound_concepts).



## ALSA, JACK, pulseaudio
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) is the basic building block for Linux Audio.
A good overview is provided at
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture).

For details, look at the project home page 
[https://alsa-project.org](https://alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page)
which e.g. provides an overview on the 
[user space applications](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/ALSA_User_Info).

More information is available e.g. at
[volkerschatz.com](http://www.volkerschatz.com/noise/alsa.html)
or
[st.com](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/ALSA_overview)
or
[debianforum](https://wiki.debianforum.de/Audiokonfiguration)

JACK is particularly targeted for low-latency audio processing. See
[jackaudio.org/](https://jackaudio.org/)
or
[qjackctl](https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/).



## Audacity and other applications

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is probably the easiest start to audio recording and processing.
The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)) provides an overview on its features.

[Ardour](https://ardour.org/) appears to be a quite powerful DAW (digital audio workstation).

[Guitarix](https://guitarix.org/) could also be worth a look.


## USB audio
A brief overview on USB Digital Audio is given at
[source.android.com](https://source.android.com/devices/audio/usb).
Many more details are provided at 
[thewelltemperedcomputer.com](https://thewelltemperedcomputer.com):
[HW/USB_Audio](https://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/HW/USB_Audio.htm), 
[KB/USB](https://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/KB/USB.html).
The specs are available at 
[usb.org](http://www.usb.org/):
[UAC1](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/USB_AV_Specification_Rev_1.0.zip),
[UAC2](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/Audio2.0_final.zip).
